## EVA 5 - Assignment 12 - ResNet18 model on Tiny Imagenet dataset

#### Problem Statement

1. Assignment A:

----  i.Download this TINY IMAGENET dataset.
   
----  ii.Train ResNet18 on this dataset (70/30 split) for 50 Epochs. Target 50%+ Validation Accuracy.
   
----  iii.Submit Results. Of course, you are using your own package for everything. You can look at this for reference.

2.Assignment B:

----  i.Download 50 (min) images each of people wearing hardhat, vest, mask and boots.
  
----  ii.Use these labels (same spelling and small letters): hardhat,vest,mask,boots
  
----  iii.Use this to annotate bounding boxes around the hardhat, vest, mask and boots.
  
----  iv.Download JSON file.
  
----  v.Describe the contents of this JSON file in FULL details (you don't need to describe all 10 instances, anyone would work).
  
----  vi.Refer to this tutorial . Find out the best total numbers of clusters. Upload link to your Colab File uploaded to GitHub.
